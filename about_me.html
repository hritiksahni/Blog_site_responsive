                 <p  class="article_body"><strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth
                         was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.</p>
                        <p  class="article_body">Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I 
                             couldn't hold a relationship.</p>

                            <h3 class="aboutme_text">How I turned things around</h3>

                            <p class="article_body"><strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</strong>. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage,
                                sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
                            <p  class="article_body">It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place,
                                I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>

                                <h3 class="aboutme_text">Now I live the simple life</h3>
                                        <p  class="article_body">Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more,
                                            and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
                                                <p class="article_body">With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>, 
                                                    and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
